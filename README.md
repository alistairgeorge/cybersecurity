## Overview
### 1. Introduction to Ethical Hacking
#### Definition
Ethical hacking involves the probing and testing of computer systems, networks, and applications purposely to identify and make amends on security vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker alias white-hat or pen tester, is mandated with similar goals to enhance security within an organization.

#### Purpose
The primary objective of ethical hacking is to identify and address application, network, and system security flaws before they are exploited by malicious hackers. This proactive strategy enhances security and safeguards sensitive data. The proactive approach of ethical hacking ensures the strength of organizational defenses against cyberattacks, protection of sensitive information, and compliance with security standards and regulations. This understanding and subsequent simulation of techniques used by cybercriminals make ethical hackers pivotal in maintaining a good state of cybersecurity and the protection of digital assets.

#### Types of Hackers

- **White Hat Hackers**: Companies and government agencies hire white hats as information security analysts, cybersecurity researchers, security specialists, penetration testers, etc. They work as independent consultants or freelancers as well. White Hat Hackers look for bugs and ethically report them to the organization. They are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to the organization. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers. To become a white hat hacker, you can earn a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology, or cybersecurity. In addition, certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) are highly recommended.Unlike other types of hackers, white hat hackers ensure their activities fall within the legal framework. And this point makes them different from red hat hackers, which we’ll talk about later in the article.

- **Black Hat Hackers**: When the organization doesn’t allow the user to test it, they unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. To make money, they are ready to do all illegal activities such as:

  - Sending phishing emails and SMS messages.
  - Writing, distributing, and selling malware like viruses, worms, trojan horses, etc.
  - Deploying cyber attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) to slow down or crash the websites.
  - Earning money for doing political and corporate espionage.
  - Finding and exploiting leaky databases and software vulnerabilities.
  - Selling financial and personally identifiable information on the Dark Web.
  - Executing financial fraud and identity theft-related crimes.
  - Deploying dangerous cyber threats like brute-force attacks, scareware, botnets, man-in-the-middle attacks, malvertizing campaigns, etc.
  - Blackmailing the victims using ransomware and spyware to encrypt, lock, steal, modify, and delete your data.
  - Demanding extortion money to give back access to the files, system, databases, or the entire device. 
  - Blackmail victims, threatening to reveal their confidential data, business documents, personal photos, videos, etc., to the public if they don’t pay. 

 They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.

- **Grey Hat Hackers**: They sometimes access to the data and violates the law, but never have the same intention as Black hat hackers. They often operate for the common good. The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company. Grey hat hackers draw the owner’s attention to the existing vulnerabilities. They often launch the same type of cyber-attacks as white hats on a company/government servers and websites. These attacks expose the security loopholes but don’t cause any damage. However, again, they do this without the owner’s knowledge or permission. Grey hat hackers sometimes charge a fee to:

  -  Fix bugs or vulnerabilities,

  - Strengthen the organization’s security defenses, or
  - Provide recommendations, solutions, or tools to patch vulnerabilities. 

  One criticism of Grey Hat hackers is that their actions can still cause harm. Even if they do not steal or damage data, their unauthorized access to computer systems can still disrupt operations and cause financial losses for companies. Additionally, there is always the risk that a Grey Hat hacker will accidentally cause damage while attempting to identify vulnerabilities.

- **Blue Hat hackers**: They are much like the script kiddies as they are beginners in the field of hacking. If anyone makes a script kiddie angry and he/she may take revenge, then they are considered as the blue hat hackers.These hackers don’t necessarily care about money or fame. They hack to take personal revenge for a real — or perceived — sleight from a person, employer, institution, or government. Blue hat hackers use malware and deploy various cyber attacks on their enemies’ servers/networks to cause harm to their data, websites, or devices.

  Sometimes, blue hat hackers use various hacking technics to bypass authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to their targets’ email clients or social media profiles. This gives them the ability to send emails and post inappropriate messages from those profiles to take revenge.
  At times, they engage in doxxing and post personal and confidential data of their nemeses in public channels to ruin their reputations. Sometimes, ex-employees hack into companies’ servers or steal their customers’ confidential data and release it to the public just to damage their former employers’ reputations.
  
     Like the Script Kiddies, Blue hat hackers also have no desire to learn.

- **Green Hat hackers**: They are also amateurs in the world of hacking but they are bit different from script kiddies. They care about hacking and strive to become full-blown hackers. They are inspired by the hackers and ask them questions about it in order to learn more. While hackers are answering their question they will listen to its novelty.  

  Although their intention is not necessarily to cause harm, they may do so while “playing” with various malware and attack techniques. As a result, green hat hackers can also be harmful because they often are not aware of the consequences of their actions — or worse, how to fix them.

- **Script Kiddies**: There’s another type of hacker that’s similar to a green hat hacker — they’re known as “script kiddies.” Script kiddies are also amateur hackers, but instead of learning new hacking techniques and programming, they’re simply interested in downloading or buying the malware, tools, and scripts online and using them. The main difference between green hats and script kiddie is that the former is quite serious and hardworking, having a clear vision to improve their skills. The latter, on the other hand, is just interested in using pre-existing scripts and codes to hack.

  Green hat hackers often take the proper educational path, earning certificates, and taking skill development courses to learn hacking. But script kiddies simply find shortcuts, like watching YouTube videos or reading some online articles or forum discussions. Basically, they like to execute hacks and cyber attacks without having complete knowledge of the consequences.

- **Red Hat Hackers**: They are also known as the eagle-eyed hackers. Like white hat hackers, red hat hackers also aims to halt the black hat hackers. There is a major difference in the way they operate. They become ruthless while dealing with malware and the actions of the black hat hackers. they take the wrong path to do the right thing. When they find a black hat hacker, they deploy dangerous cyber attacks against them. Red hat hackers use all types of tactics to do this, including:

  - Infecting the bad hackers’ systems with malware,
  - Launching DDoS attacks,
  - Using tools to gain remote access to the hacker’s computer to demolish it.

  In short, red hats are the types of hackers who often choose to take aggressive steps to stop black hat hackers. They’re known to launch full-scale attacks to bring down the bad guys’ servers and destroy their resources.

#### Legal and Ethical Considerations
Ethical hacking is entirely legal, but it operates under strict guidelines. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers have explicit permission to probe systems and search for vulnerabilities. Key aspects of the legality include:

- Permission: Ethical hackers must have clear, written permission to probe systems and agree to respect the privacy of any data seen during testing.

- Scope of Work: Before an ethical hacking engagement, there should be a clear understanding of the scope of work, including which systems can be tested and which testing methods are allowed.

- Reporting: Ethical hackers must document their findings and present them to the organization, typically including identified vulnerabilities and recommended remediation strategies.

### 2. Networking Basics

Computer networking is a cornerstone of modern technology, enabling the interconnected systems that power the Internet, business communications, and everyday digital interactions. Understanding the fundamentals of computer networking is essential for anyone involved in technology, from enthusiasts to professionals. A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information. These devices can include computers, servers, printers, and other hardware. Networks allow for the efficient exchange of data, enabling various applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing.

- #### TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. It is a set of conventions or rules and methods that are used to interconnect network devices on the Internet. The internet protocol suite is commonly known as TCP/IP, as the foundational protocols in the suite are Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. It chooses how the information will be traded over the web through end-to-end communications that incorporate how the information ought to be organized into bundles (bundles of data), addressed, sent, and received at the goal. This communication protocol can also be utilized to interconnect organize devices in a private network such as an intranet or an extranet.

- #### OSI Model
The OSI model, created in 1984 by ISO , is a reference framework that explains the process of transmitting data between computers. It is divided into seven layers that work together to carry out specialised network functions , allowing for a more systematic approach to networking.When we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model. First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender’s end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver’s end.

Data flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process:

 - Application Layer: Applications create the data.
 - Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
 - Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.
 - Transport Layer: Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
 - Network Layer : Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
 - Data Link Layer: Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
 - Physical Layer: Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.
 - Each layer adds specific information to ensure the data reaches its destination correctly, and these steps are reversed upon arrival.
#### Subnetting
When a bigger network is divided into smaller networks, to maintain security, then that is known as Subnetting. So, maintenance is easier for smaller networks. For example, if we consider a class A address, the possible number of hosts is 224 for each network, it is obvious that it is difficult to maintain such a huge number of hosts, but it would be quite easier to maintain if we divide the network into small parts.  

Uses of Subnetting
Subnetting helps in organizing the network in an efficient way which helps in expanding the technology for large firms and companies.
Subnetting is used for specific staffing structures to reduce traffic and maintain order and efficiency.
Subnetting divides domains of the broadcast so that traffic is routed efficiently, which helps in improving network performance.
Subnetting is used in increasing network security.
The network can be divided into two parts: To divide a network into two parts, you need to choose one bit for each Subnet from the host ID part.
#### DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) allows you to interact with devices on the Internet without having to remember long strings of numbers. Each computer on the Internet has its own unique address, known as an IP address, just like every home has a unique address for sending direct mail. 104.26.10.228 is an IP address consisting of four sets of numbers extending from 0 to 255 separated by a period. It’s not easy having to remember this complicated collection of numbers every time you want to access a website, which is where DNS comes in handy.
#### DHCP 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network protocol used to automate the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices (such as computers, smartphones, and printers) on a network. Instead of manually configuring each device with an IP address, DHCP allows devices to connect to a network and receive all necessary network information, like IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses, automatically from a DHCP server.

This makes it easier to manage and maintain large networks, ensuring devices can communicate effectively without conflicts in their network settings. DHCP plays a crucial role in modern networks by simplifying the process of connecting devices and managing network resources efficiently.
