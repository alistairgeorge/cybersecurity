## Overview
### 1. Introduction to Ethical Hacking
#### Definition
Ethical hacking involves the probing and testing of computer systems, networks, and applications purposely to identify and make amends on security vulnerabilities. An ethical hacker alias white-hat or pen tester, is mandated with similar goals to enhance security within an organization.

#### Purpose
The primary objective of ethical hacking is to identify and address application, network, and system security flaws before they are exploited by malicious hackers. This proactive strategy enhances security and safeguards sensitive data. The proactive approach of ethical hacking ensures the strength of organizational defenses against cyberattacks, protection of sensitive information, and compliance with security standards and regulations. This understanding and subsequent simulation of techniques used by cybercriminals make ethical hackers pivotal in maintaining a good state of cybersecurity and the protection of digital assets.

#### Types of Hackers

- **White Hat Hackers**: Companies and government agencies hire white hats as information security analysts, cybersecurity researchers, security specialists, penetration testers, etc. They work as independent consultants or freelancers as well. White Hat Hackers look for bugs and ethically report them to the organization. They are authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to the organization. White hat hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked by malicious hackers. To become a white hat hacker, you can earn a bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology, or cybersecurity. In addition, certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) are highly recommended.Unlike other types of hackers, white hat hackers ensure their activities fall within the legal framework. And this point makes them different from red hat hackers, which we’ll talk about later in the article.

- **Black Hat Hackers**: When the organization doesn’t allow the user to test it, they unethically enter inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. To make money, they are ready to do all illegal activities such as:

  - Sending phishing emails and SMS messages.
  - Writing, distributing, and selling malware like viruses, worms, trojan horses, etc.
  - Deploying cyber attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS) to slow down or crash the websites.
  - Earning money for doing political and corporate espionage.
  - Finding and exploiting leaky databases and software vulnerabilities.
  - Selling financial and personally identifiable information on the Dark Web.
  - Executing financial fraud and identity theft-related crimes.
  - Deploying dangerous cyber threats like brute-force attacks, scareware, botnets, man-in-the-middle attacks, malvertizing campaigns, etc.
  - Blackmailing the victims using ransomware and spyware to encrypt, lock, steal, modify, and delete your data.
  - Demanding extortion money to give back access to the files, system, databases, or the entire device. 
  - Blackmail victims, threatening to reveal their confidential data, business documents, personal photos, videos, etc., to the public if they don’t pay. 

 They can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.

- **Grey Hat Hackers**: They sometimes access to the data and violates the law, but never have the same intention as Black hat hackers. They often operate for the common good. The main difference is that they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company. Grey hat hackers draw the owner’s attention to the existing vulnerabilities. They often launch the same type of cyber-attacks as white hats on a company/government servers and websites. These attacks expose the security loopholes but don’t cause any damage. However, again, they do this without the owner’s knowledge or permission. Grey hat hackers sometimes charge a fee to:

  -  Fix bugs or vulnerabilities,

  - Strengthen the organization’s security defenses, or
  - Provide recommendations, solutions, or tools to patch vulnerabilities. 

  One criticism of Grey Hat hackers is that their actions can still cause harm. Even if they do not steal or damage data, their unauthorized access to computer systems can still disrupt operations and cause financial losses for companies. Additionally, there is always the risk that a Grey Hat hacker will accidentally cause damage while attempting to identify vulnerabilities.

- **Blue Hat hackers**: They are much like the script kiddies as they are beginners in the field of hacking. If anyone makes a script kiddie angry and he/she may take revenge, then they are considered as the blue hat hackers.These hackers don’t necessarily care about money or fame. They hack to take personal revenge for a real — or perceived — sleight from a person, employer, institution, or government. Blue hat hackers use malware and deploy various cyber attacks on their enemies’ servers/networks to cause harm to their data, websites, or devices.

  Sometimes, blue hat hackers use various hacking technics to bypass authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to their targets’ email clients or social media profiles. This gives them the ability to send emails and post inappropriate messages from those profiles to take revenge.
  At times, they engage in doxxing and post personal and confidential data of their nemeses in public channels to ruin their reputations. Sometimes, ex-employees hack into companies’ servers or steal their customers’ confidential data and release it to the public just to damage their former employers’ reputations.
  
     Like the Script Kiddies, Blue hat hackers also have no desire to learn.

- **Green Hat hackers**: They are also amateurs in the world of hacking but they are bit different from script kiddies. They care about hacking and strive to become full-blown hackers. They are inspired by the hackers and ask them questions about it in order to learn more. While hackers are answering their question they will listen to its novelty.  

  Although their intention is not necessarily to cause harm, they may do so while “playing” with various malware and attack techniques. As a result, green hat hackers can also be harmful because they often are not aware of the consequences of their actions — or worse, how to fix them.

- **Script Kiddies**: There’s another type of hacker that’s similar to a green hat hacker — they’re known as “script kiddies.” Script kiddies are also amateur hackers, but instead of learning new hacking techniques and programming, they’re simply interested in downloading or buying the malware, tools, and scripts online and using them. The main difference between green hats and script kiddie is that the former is quite serious and hardworking, having a clear vision to improve their skills. The latter, on the other hand, is just interested in using pre-existing scripts and codes to hack.

  Green hat hackers often take the proper educational path, earning certificates, and taking skill development courses to learn hacking. But script kiddies simply find shortcuts, like watching YouTube videos or reading some online articles or forum discussions. Basically, they like to execute hacks and cyber attacks without having complete knowledge of the consequences.

- **Red Hat Hackers**: They are also known as the eagle-eyed hackers. Like white hat hackers, red hat hackers also aims to halt the black hat hackers. There is a major difference in the way they operate. They become ruthless while dealing with malware and the actions of the black hat hackers. they take the wrong path to do the right thing. When they find a black hat hacker, they deploy dangerous cyber attacks against them. Red hat hackers use all types of tactics to do this, including:

  - Infecting the bad hackers’ systems with malware,
  - Launching DDoS attacks,
  - Using tools to gain remote access to the hacker’s computer to demolish it.

  In short, red hats are the types of hackers who often choose to take aggressive steps to stop black hat hackers. They’re known to launch full-scale attacks to bring down the bad guys’ servers and destroy their resources.

#### Legal and Ethical Considerations
Ethical hacking is entirely legal, but it operates under strict guidelines. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers have explicit permission to probe systems and search for vulnerabilities. Key aspects of the legality include:

- Permission: Ethical hackers must have clear, written permission to probe systems and agree to respect the privacy of any data seen during testing.

- Scope of Work: Before an ethical hacking engagement, there should be a clear understanding of the scope of work, including which systems can be tested and which testing methods are allowed.

- Reporting: Ethical hackers must document their findings and present them to the organization, typically including identified vulnerabilities and recommended remediation strategies.

### 2. Networking Basics

Computer networking is a cornerstone of modern technology, enabling the interconnected systems that power the Internet, business communications, and everyday digital interactions. Understanding the fundamentals of computer networking is essential for anyone involved in technology, from enthusiasts to professionals. A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that share resources and information. These devices can include computers, servers, printers, and other hardware. Networks allow for the efficient exchange of data, enabling various applications such as email, file sharing, and internet browsing.

- #### TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. It is a set of conventions or rules and methods that are used to interconnect network devices on the Internet. The internet protocol suite is commonly known as TCP/IP, as the foundational protocols in the suite are Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. It chooses how the information will be traded over the web through end-to-end communications that incorporate how the information ought to be organized into bundles (bundles of data), addressed, sent, and received at the goal. This communication protocol can also be utilized to interconnect organize devices in a private network such as an intranet or an extranet.

- #### OSI Model
The OSI model, created in 1984 by the International standards organization (ISO), is a reference framework that explains the process of transmitting data between computers. It is divided into seven layers that work together to carry out specialised network functions , allowing for a more systematic approach to networking.When we transfer information from one device to another, it travels through 7 layers of OSI model. First data travels down through 7 layers from the sender’s end and then climbs back 7 layers on the receiver’s end.

Data flows through the OSI model in a step-by-step process:

 - Application Layer: Applications create the data.
 - Presentation Layer: Data is formatted and encrypted.
 - Session Layer: Connections are established and managed.
 - Transport Layer: Data is broken into segments for reliable delivery.
 - Network Layer : Segments are packaged into packets and routed.
 - Data Link Layer: Packets are framed and sent to the next device.
 - Physical Layer: Frames are converted into bits and transmitted physically.
 
 Each layer adds specific information to ensure the data reaches its destination correctly, and these steps are reversed upon arrival.

#### Subnetting
When a bigger network is divided into smaller networks, to maintain security, then that is known as Subnetting. So, maintenance is easier for smaller networks. For example, if we consider a class A address, the possible number of hosts is 224 for each network. It is obvious that it is difficult to maintain such a huge number of hosts, but it would be much easier to maintain if we divide the network into small parts.  

**Uses of Subnetting**

Subnetting helps in organizing the network in an efficient way which helps in expanding the technology for large firms and companies.
Subnetting is used for specific staffing structures to reduce traffic and maintain order and efficiency.
Subnetting divides domains of the broadcast so that traffic is routed efficiently, which helps in improving network performance.
Subnetting is used in increasing network security.
The network can be divided into two parts: To divide a network into two parts, you need to choose one bit for each Subnet from the host ID part.
#### DNS
DNS (Domain Name System) allows you to interact with devices on the Internet without having to remember long strings of numbers. Each computer on the Internet has its own unique address, known as an IP address, just like every home has a unique address for sending direct mail. 104.26.10.228 is an IP address consisting of four sets of numbers extending from 0 to 255 separated by a period. It’s not easy having to remember this complicated collection of numbers every time you want to access a website, which is where DNS comes in handy.
#### DHCP 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a network protocol used to automate the process of assigning IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices (such as computers, smartphones, and printers) on a network. Instead of manually configuring each device with an IP address, DHCP allows devices to connect to a network and receive all necessary network information, like IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses, automatically from a DHCP server.

This makes it easier to manage and maintain large networks, ensuring devices can communicate effectively without conflicts in their network settings. DHCP plays a crucial role in modern networks by simplifying the process of connecting devices and managing network resources efficiently.
### 3. Operating Systems
An Operating System(OS) is a software that manages and handles hardware and software resources of a computing device. An operating system is an interface between the user and the hardware. It is a program that helps to utilize system hardware so it is also known as a resource manager. There are different types of operating systems based on different system architectures. , each with its own features and uses.
#### Linux
The Linux OS is an open source operating system project that is a freely distributed, cross-platform operating system developed based on UNIX. This operating system is developed by Linus Torvalds. The name Linux comes from the Linux kernel. It is basically the system software on a computer that allows apps and users to perform some specific task on the computer. The development of Linux operating system pioneered the open source development and became the symbol of software collaboration.

**Features:**
- Linux is free can be downloaded from the Internet or redistribute it under GNU licenses and has the best community support.
- Linux OS is easily portable which means it can be installed on various types of devices like mobile, tablet computers.
- It is a multi-user, multitasking operating system.
- BASH is the Linux interpreter program which can be used to execute commands.
- Linux provides multiple levels of file structures i.e. hierarchical structure in which all the files required by the system and those that are created by the user are arranged.
- Linux provides user security using authentication features and also threat detection and solution is very fast because Linux is mainly community driven.
  
**Drawbacks:**
- There’s no standard edition of Linux hence confusing for users and also becoming familiar with the Linux may be a problem for new users.
- More difficult to find applications to support user needs since Linux does not dominate the market.
- Since some applications are developed specifically for Windows and Mac, those might not be compatible with linux and sometimes users might not have much of a choice to choose between different applications like in Windows or Mac since most apps are developed for operating systems that have a huge user base.
- Some hardware may not be incompatible with Linux since it has patchier support for drivers which may result in malfunction.
- There are plenty of forums to resolve Linux issues, but it may not always match the user’s own level of technical understanding.
#### Windows
Windows is an operating system designed by Microsoft to be used on a standard x86 Intel and AMD processors. It provides an interface, known as a graphical user interface(GUI) which eliminates the need to memorize commands for the command line by using a mouse to navigate through menus, dialog boxes, buttons, tabs, and icons. The operating system was named windows since the programs are displayed in the shape of a square. This Windows operating system has been designed for both a novice user just using at home as well as for professionals who are into development. 
**Features**
- It is designed to run on any standard x86 Intel and AMD hence most of the hardware vendors make drivers for windows like Dell, HP, etc.
- It supports enhanced performance by utilizing multi-core processors.
- It comes preloaded with many productivity tools which helps to complete all types of everyday tasks on your computer.
- Windows has a very large user base so there is a much larger selection of available software programs, utilities.
- Windows is backward compatible meaning old programs can run on newer versions.
- Hardware is automatically detected eliminating need of manually installing any device drivers.
  
**Drawbacks**
- Windows can be expensive since the OS is paid license and majority of its applications are paid products.
- Windows has high computer resource requirement like it should have high ram capacity, a lot of hard drive space and good graphics card.
- Windows slows and hangs up if the user loads up many programs at the same time.
- Windows includes network sharing that can be useful if user has a network with many PCs.
- Windows is vulnerable to virus attacks since it has a huge user base and users have to update OS to keep up-to-date with security patches.

#### macOS
MacOS is a proprietary, Unix-based operating system developed by Apple Inc. It is the primary operating system for Apple’s Mac computers and laptops. It was first introduced in 2001 as Mac OS X, and was later renamed to macOS in 2016.

**Features**
- User-friendly interface: macOS has a clean and intuitive graphical user interface, making it easy to use for both beginners and advanced users.
- Integration with Apple’s ecosystem: macOS integrates well with Apple’s other products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, allowing for seamless connectivity and data transfer between devices.
- Built-in applications: macOS comes with a range of built-in applications, such as iMessage, FaceTime, and Safari, making it possible to perform a wide range of tasks without having to install additional software.
- High-quality software: Apple is known for its focus on quality, and macOS is no exception. The operating system includes high-quality applications and is known for its stability and reliability.
  
**Drawbacks**
- Price: macOS is a proprietary operating system, and Mac computers are typically more expensive than other types of computers.
- Limited hardware compatibility: Because macOS is only available on Apple’s Mac computers and laptops, users are limited in terms of hardware compatibility, especially when compared to other operating systems like Windows or Linux.
- Proprietary software: Many of the applications and software available for macOS are proprietary and only available from Apple’s App Store, which can limit user choice and flexibility.
- Lack of customization: Unlike other operating systems, such as Linux, macOS has limited customization options, making it less flexible for advanced users who want to change the look and feel of their operating system.
#### Command Line Basics 
### 4. Cybersecurity Fundamentals
#### Encryption

Data Encryption is a method of preserving data confidentiality by transforming it into ciphertext, which can only be decoded using a unique decryption key produced at the time of the encryption or before it. The conversion of plaintext into ciphertext is known as encryption.

Key Objective of Encryption Data
- Confidentiality: Encryption ensures that only authorized parties can get access to data and recognize the information.
- Data Integrity: Encryption can also provide data integrity by making sure that the encrypted data remains unchanged during transmission. Any unauthorized changes to the encrypted information will render it undecipherable or will fail integrity checks.
- Authentication: Encryption may be used as part of authentication mechanisms to verify the identification of the communication party.
- Non-Repudiation: Through encryption, events can make sure that they cannot deny their involvement in growing or sending a selected piece of data.

The significance of encryption cannot be overstated in any way. Even though your data is stored in a standard infrastructure, it is still possible for it to be hacked. There’s always the chance that data will be compromised, but with data encryption, your information will be much more secure. Consider it this way for a moment. If your data is stored in a secure system, encrypting it before sending it out will keep it safe.
#### Firewalls

A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic.

- Accept: allow the traffic
- Reject: block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error”
- Drop: block the traffic with no reply


 Firewalls typically welcome incoming connections that are allowed to access a network. The security systems will allow or block data packets based on existing security rules. Firewalls build checkpoints that filter web traffic. These systems let you review and act upon rogue network traffic before the attacked network experiences any adverse effects.

With a dependable firewall in place, only trusted sources and IP addresses can access your client’s systems. Some firewalls can also monitor audit logs to find connections and traffic that have gotten through.

Use firewalls to gate the borders of private networks and the host devices. Ensure that you include robust firewalls when setting up user access controls. You can set up these barriers on user computers or dedicated computers on the network.

#### Antivirus

Antivirus software (antivirus program) is a security program designed to prevent, detect, search and remove viruses and other types of malware from computers, networks and other devices.
It is typically installed on a computer as a proactive approach to cybersecurity, an antivirus program can help mitigate a variety of cyber threats, including keyloggers, browser hijackers, Trojan horses, worms, rootkits, spyware, adware, botnets, phishing attempts and ransomware attacks.

Antivirus software typically runs as a background process, scanning computers, servers or mobile devices to detect and restrict the spread of malware. Many antivirus software programs include real-time threat detection and protection to guard against potential vulnerabilities and perform system scans that monitor device and system files, looking for possible risks.

Antivirus software usually performs the following basic functions:
- Scans directories or specific files against a library of known malicious signatures to detect abnormal patterns indicating the presence of malicious software.
- Enables users to schedule scans so they run automatically.
- Lets users initiate new scans at any time.
- Removes any malicious software it detects either automatically in the background or notifies users of infections and prompts them to clean the files.
- To scan systems comprehensively, antivirus software must generally be given privileged access to the entire system. This makes antivirus software itself a common target for attackers, and researchers have discovered remote code execution and other serious vulnerabilities in antivirus software products in recent years.
#### IDS/IPS 
**IDS**:An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors the traffic on a computer network to detect any suspicious activity.
It analyzes the data flowing through the network to look for patterns and signs of abnormal behavior.
The IDS compares the network activity to a set of predefined rules and patterns to identify any activity that might indicate an attack or intrusion.

If the IDS detects something that matches one of these rules or patterns, it sends an alert to the system administrator.
The system administrator can then investigate the alert and take action to prevent any damage or further intrusion.
IDS monitors a network or system for malicious activity and protects a computer network from unauthorized access from users, including perhaps insiders. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between ‘bad connections’ (intrusion/attacks) and ‘good (normal) connections’.



Intrusion Detection System Evasion Techniques:
- Fragmentation: Dividing the packet into smaller packets called fragments. This makes it impossible to identify an intrusion because there can’t be a malware signature.
- Packet Encoding: Encoding packets using methods like Base64 or hexadecimal can hide malicious content from signature-based IDS.
- Traffic Obfuscation: By making message more complicated to interpret, obfuscation can be utilised to hide an attack and avoid detection.
- Encryption: Several security features, such as data integrity, confidentiality, and data privacy, are provided by encryption. Unfortunately, security features are used by malware developers to hide attacks and avoid detection.

**IPS**: IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) is a network security application that monitors network or system activities for malicious activity. It is also known as Intrusion Detection and Prevention System.  Major functions of intrusion prevention systems are to identify malicious activity, collect information about this activity, report it and attempt to block or stop it. 



IPS typically record information related to observed events, notify security administrators of important observed events and produce reports. Many IPS can also respond to a detected threat by attempting to prevent it from succeeding. They use various response techniques, which involve the IPS stopping the attack itself, changing the security environment or changing the attack’s content. 

There are several techniques that intrusion prevention systems use to identify threats:

- Signature-based: This method matches the activity to signatures of well-known threats. One drawback to this method is that it can only stop previously identified attacks and won’t be able to recognize new ones.

- Anomaly-based: This method monitors for abnormal behavior by comparing random samples of network activity against a baseline standard. It is more robust than signature-based monitoring, but it can sometimes produce false positives. Some newer and more advanced intrusion prevention systems use artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to support anomaly-based monitoring.

- Policy-based: This method is somewhat less common than signature-based or anomaly-based monitoring. It employs security policies defined by the enterprise and blocks activity that violates those policies. This requires an administrator to set up and configure security policies.

**Comparision of IDS and IPS:**

Intrusion prevention systems are contemplated as augmentation of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) because both IPS and IDS operate network traffic and system activities for malicious activity. 

When IDS detects intrusion it only alerts network administration while Intrusion Prevention System(IPS) blocks the malicious packets before it reaches to destination.

#### Vulnerability Scanning 
### 7. Exploitation
#### Common Vulnerabilities and Exploits
Any flaw in an organization’s internal controls, system procedures, or information systems is a vulnerability in cyber security. Cybercriminals and Hackers may target these vulnerabilities and exploit them through the points of vulnerability.

These hackers can enter the networks without authorization and seriously harm data privacy. Data being a gold mine in this modern world is something that has to be secured preciously. As a result, it is crucial to constantly check for cybersecurity vulnerabilities because flaws in a network could lead to a complete compromise of an organization’s systems.
#### Metasploit Framework
It is an open-source project which offers the public resources to develop codes and research security vulnerabilities. It permits the network administrators for breaking their network to recognize security threats and also document which vulnerability requires to be defined first.

It is a type of project that facilitates Pen (Penetration) testing software. Also, it offers tools to automate the comparison of a vulnerability of a program and its patched (repaired) version. It also offers advanced evasion and anti-forensic tools. A few of these tools are created into the framework of Metasploit.
#### Buffer Overflows 
A buffer is a temporary area for data storage. When more data (than was originally allocated to be stored) gets placed by a program or system process, the extra data overflows. It causes some of that data to leak out into other buffers, which can corrupt or overwrite whatever data they were holding.
In a buffer-overflow attack, the extra data sometimes holds specific instructions for actions intended by a hacker or malicious user; for example, the data could trigger a response that damages files, changes data or unveils private information.

Attacker would use a buffer-overflow exploit to take advantage of a program that is waiting on a user’s input. There are two types of buffer overflows: stack-based and heap-based. Heap-based, which are difficult to execute and the least common of the two, attack an application by flooding the memory space reserved for a program. Stack-based buffer overflows, which are more common among attackers, exploit applications and programs by using what is known as a stack memory space used to store user input.

### 10. Social Engineering
#### Phishing

Phishing is a form of online fraud in which hackers attempt to get your private information such as passwords, credit cards, or bank account data. This is usually done by sending false emails or messages that appear to be from trusted sources like banks or well-known websites. They aim to convince you so that they can manage to have your information and use it as a fraudster.

Phishing got its name from “phish” meaning fish. It’s a common phenomenon to put bait for the fish to get trapped. Similarly, phishing works. It is an unethical way to dupe the user or victim to click on harmful sites. The attacker crafts the harmful site in such a way that the victim feels it to be an authentic site, thus falling prey to it. The most common mode of phishing is by sending spam emails that appear to be authentic and thus, taking away all credentials from the victim. The main motive of the attacker behind phishing is to gain confidential information like:

Password
Credit card details
Social security numbers
Date of birth
The attacker uses this information to further target the user impersonate the user and cause data theft. The most common type of phishing attack happens through email. Phishing victims are tricked into revealing information that they think should be kept private. The original logo of the email is used to make the user believe that it is indeed the original email. But if we carefully look into the details, we will find that the URL or web address is not authentic. 
#### Spear Phishing

Phishing attacks are a persistent threat in a highly digital world, one that is an ongoing concern for both individuals and organizations. Spear phishing attacks are a subset of these types of cybercrimes that are of particular concern.
#### Social Engineering Toolkit (SET) 

The Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) is a collection of Python scripts written by David Kennedy (ReL1K) which can help automate many aspects of social engineering attacks. It is integrated with Metasploit in order to use Metasploit’s exploit repository as well as the available exploit payloads. SET focuses on a number of social engineering-based attacks and provides the ability to easily create the necessary files and templates for those attacks. The current version is available through the web site https://www.trustedsec.com/ where you can also find a variety of presentations and tutorials.

The toolkit is updated frequently and its functionality is constantly expanding. As of the time of this writing, the current version is version 7.0.6. This version supports the following attack vectors:

●
Spear-Phishing

●
Web Sites

●
Malicious USB/DVD/CDs

●
Arduino

●
Wireless Access Points

●
QRCodes

●
… and many others.
### 11. Sniffing and Spoofing
#### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

A man in the middle (MITM) attack is a general term for when a perpetrator positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application—either to eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties, making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway.

The goal of an attack is to steal personal information, such as login credentials, account details and credit card numbers. Targets are typically the users of financial applications, Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses, e-commerce sites and other websites where logging in is required.

Information obtained during an attack could be used for many purposes, including identity theft, unapproved fund transfers or an illicit password change.

Additionally, it can be used to gain a foothold inside a secured perimeter during the infiltration stage of an advanced persistent threat (APT) assault.
#### ARP Spoofing

ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is a communication protocol that is one of the important network layer protocols in the OSI model and is used to determine a device’s Media Access Control (MAC) address based on its Internet Protocol (IP) address in order to communicate with other devices on the network.

ARP spoofing is a cyber attack that allows hackers to intercept communications between network devices on a network. Hackers can also use ARP spoofing to alter or block all traffic between devices on the network.

Working:
- Scanning: Hackers use ARP spoofing tools to scan the IP and MAC addresses of hosts.
- Selection and Launching: Hackers select their target and then send ARP packets over the local network containing the hacker’s MAC address and the target’s IP address.
- Accessing: Once the ARP cache on the host on the local network is corrupted. Then the data the host wants to send to the victim is sent to the hacker instead of the victim. Hackers can steal data or launch other attacks from here.

#### DNS Spoofing 
Domain Name System (DNS) poisoning happens when fake information is entered into the cache of a domain name server, resulting in DNS queries producing an incorrect reply, sending users to the wrong website. DNS poisoning also goes by the terms “DNS spoofing” and “DNS cache poisoning.”

In regard to DNS, the most prominent threats are two-fold:

- DNS spoofing is the resulting threat which mimics legitimate server destinations to redirect a domain’s traffic. Unsuspecting victims end up on malicious websites, which is the goal that results from various methods of DNS spoofing attacks.
- DNS cache poisoning is a user-end method of DNS spoofing, in which your system logs the fraudulent IP address in your local memory cache. This leads the DNS to recall the bad site specifically for you, even if the issue gets resolved or never existed on the server-end.

Here are some common risks of DNS poisoning and spoofing:

- Data theft: Banking websites and popular online retailers are easily hit, meaning any password, credit card, or personal information may be compromised. The redirects would be to phishing websites designed to collect your information.

- Malware infection: With a spoof redirecting you, the destination could end up being a site infested with malicious downloads. Drive by downloads are an easy way to automate the infection of your system. Ultimately, if you’re not using internet security, you’re exposed to risks like spyware, keyloggers, or worms.
- Halted security updates: If spoofed sites include internet security providers, legitimate security updates will not be performed. As a result, your computer may be exposed to additional threats such as viruses or Trojans.
- Censorship: Censorship is a risk that is actually commonplace in some parts of the world. For example, China uses modifications to the DNS to ensure all websites viewed within the country are approved. This nation-level block, dubbed the “Great Firewall”, is one example of how powerful DNS spoofing can be.
### 12. Malware Analysis
Malware Analysis is the study or process of determining the functionality, origin and potential impact of a given malware sample and extracting as much information from it. The information that is extracted helps to understand the functionality and scope of malware, how the system was infected and how to defend against similar attacks in future.
#### Types of Malware
Various types of Malware are:

- Trojans – Trojans can destroy data and exfiltrate data and can also be used for spying.
- Rat’s – This type of malware allows attacker to remotely access and execute commands on system.
- Ransomware – Ransomware encrypts all files on the system and holds the System and its data for ransom.
- Dropper – Droppers functionality is to download/drop additional malware.
#### Sandbox Analysis
A sandbox is a system for malware detection that runs a suspicious object in a virtual machine (VM) with a fully-featured OS and detects the object’s malicious activity by analyzing its behavior. If the object performs malicious actions in a VM, the sandbox detects it as malware. VMs are isolated from the real business infrastructure.

Sandboxes analyze the behavior of an object as it executes, which makes them effective against malware that escapes static analysis. At the same time, compared to other behavior analysis designs, a sandbox is safer as it doesn’t risk running a suspicious object in the real business infrastructure.

### 13. Incident Response and Handling
#### Incident Response Process
Incident response (sometimes called cybersecurity incident response) refers to an organization’s processes and technologies for detecting and responding to cyberthreats, security breaches or cyberattacks. A formal incident response plan enables cybersecurity teams to limit or prevent damage.

The goal of incident response is to prevent cyberattacks before they happen and minimize the cost and business disruption resulting from any cyberattacks that occur. Incident response is the technical portion of incident management, which also includes executive, HR and legal management of a serious incident.
#### Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is the process of collecting and analyzing digital evidence in a way that maintains its integrity and admissibility in court.

Digital forensics is a field of forensic science. It is used to investigate cybercrimes but can also help with criminal and civil investigations. For instance, cybersecurity teams may use digital forensics to identify the cybercriminals behind a malware attack, while law enforcement agencies may use it to analyze data from the devices of a murder suspect.

Digital forensics has broad applications because it treats digital evidence like any other form of evidence. Just as officials use specific processes to gather physical evidence from a crime scene, digital forensics investigators follow a strict forensics process (also known as a chain of custody) when handling digital evidence to avoid tampering.
#### Chain of Custody 
Chain of Custody refers to the logical sequence that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis and disposition of physical or electronic evidence in legal cases. Each step in the chain is essential as if broke, the evidence may be rendered inadmissible. Thus we can say that preserving the chain of custody is about following the correct and consistent procedure and hence ensuring the quality of evidence.
Let’s discuss each stage of the chain of custody in detail:

- Data Collection: This is where chain of custody process is initiated. It involves identification, labeling, recording, and the acquisition of data from all the possible relevant sources that preserve the integrity of the data and evidence collected.
- Examination: During this process, the chain of custody information is documented outlining the forensic process undertaken. It is important to capture screenshots throughout the process to show the tasks that are completed and the evidence uncovered.
- Analysis: This stage is the result of the examination stage. In the Analysis stage, legally justifiable methods and techniques are used to derive useful information to address questions posed in the particular case.
- Reporting: This is the documentation phase of the Examination and Analysis stage. Reporting includes the following:
  - Statement regarding Chain of Custody.
  - Explanation of the various tools used.
  - A description of the analysis of various data sources.
  - Issues identified.
  - Vulnerabilities identified.
Recommendation for additional forensics measures that can be taken.
### 14. Penetration Testing
Penetration testing (or pen testing) is a security exercise where a cyber-security expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system. The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system’s defenses which attackers could take advantage of.

This is like a bank hiring someone to dress as a burglar and try to break into their building and gain access to the vault. If the ‘burglar’ succeeds and gets into the bank or the vault, the bank will gain valuable information on how they need to tighten their security measures.

Penetration testing helps an organization discover vulnerabilities and flaws in their systems that they might not have otherwise been able to find. This can help stop attacks before they start, as organizations can fix these vulnerabilities once they have been identified.
#### Types of Penetration Testing
- Open-box pen test - In an open-box test, the hacker will be provided with some information ahead of time regarding the target company’s security info.
- Closed-box pen test - Also known as a ‘single-blind’ test, this is one where the hacker is given no background information besides the name of the target company.
- Covert pen test - Also known as a ‘double-blind’ pen test, this is a situation where almost no one in the company is aware that the pen test is happening, including the IT and security professionals who will be responding to the attack. For covert tests, it is especially important for the hacker to have the scope and other details of the test in writing beforehand to avoid any problems with law enforcement.
- External pen test - In an external test, the ethical hacker goes up against the company’s external-facing technology, such as their website and external network servers. In some cases, the hacker may not even be allowed to enter the company’s building. This can mean conducting the attack from a remote location or carrying out the test from a truck or van parked nearby.
- Internal pen test - In an internal test, the ethical hacker performs the test from the company’s internal network. This kind of test is useful in determining how much damage a disgruntled employee can cause from behind the company’s firewall.
#### Methodology
##### 1. Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual
 
Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) is one of the most popular standards of penetration testing. This methodology is peer-reviewed for security testing and was created by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM).

The method is based on a scientific approach to pen testing with accessible and adaptable guides for testers. The OSSTMM includes key features, such as an operational focus, channel testing, metrics and trust analysis in its methodology.

OSSTMM provides a framework for network penetration testing and vulnerability assessment for pen testing professionals. It is meant to be a framework for providers to find and resolve vulnerabilities, such as sensitive data and issues surrounding authentication.

##### 2. Open Web Application Security Project
 
OWASP, short for Open Web Application Security Project, is an open-source organization dedicated to web application security.

The non-profit organization’s goal is to make all its material free and easily accessible for anyone who wants to improve their own web application security. OWASP has its own Top 10 (link resides outside of ibm.com), which is a well-maintained report outlining the biggest security concerns and risks to web applications, such as cross-site scripting, broken authentication and getting behind a firewall. OWASP uses the top 10 list as a basis for its OWASP Testing Guide. 

The guide is divided into three parts: OWASP testing framework for web application development, web application testing methodology and reporting. The web application methodology can be used separately or as a part of the web testing framework for web application penetration testing, mobile application penetration testing, API penetration testing, and IoT penetration testing.

##### 3. Penetration Testing Execution Standard
 
PTES, or Penetration Testing Execution Standard, is a comprehensive penetration testing method.

PTES was designed by a team of information security professionals and is made up of seven main sections covering all aspects of pen testing. The purpose of PTES is to have technical guidelines to outline what organizations should expect from a penetration test and guide them throughout the process, starting at the pre-engagement stage.

The PTES aims to be the baseline for penetration tests and provide a standardized methodology for security professionals and organizations. The guide provides a range of resources, such as best practices in each stage of the penetration testing process, from start to finish. Some key features of PTES are exploitation and post exploitation. Exploitation refers to the process of gaining access to a system through penetration techniques such as social engineering and password cracking. Post exploitation is when data is extracted from a compromised system and access is maintained.

##### 4. Information System Security Assessment Framework
 
Information System Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is a pen testing framework supported by the Information Systems Security Group (OISSG).

This methodology is no longer maintained and is likely not the best source for the most up-to-date information. However, one of its main strengths is that it links individual pen testing steps with specific pen testing tools. This type of format can be a good foundation for creating an individualized methodology.

##### 5. National Institute of Standards and Technology
 
NIST, short for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is a cybersecurity framework that provides a set of pen testing standards for the federal government and outside organizations to follow. NIST is an agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce and should be considered the minimum standard to follow.

NIST penetration testing aligns with the guidance sent by NIST. To comply with such guidance, organizations must perform penetration tests following the pre-determined set of guidelines.
#### Reporting 
A penetration test report provides a comprehensive summary of the system’s vulnerabilities. In addition, it includes recommendations for patching, hardening, and restricting the functionality of systems when necessary. The objective is to identify problem areas and implement a solution.  

Consider the following elements prior to writing a pentest report: 

- Specify the objectives of penetration testing
- Understand the plausible effects of a breach
- Describe the assessment procedure and any pertinent techniques

The following sections should be included in the penetration testing report:

- Executive summary – The pentesting report should begin with a summary of your findings geared towards company executives. This should be written in non-technical language so that non-security professionals can comprehend the significance of the discovered vulnerabilities and what the organisation must do to fix them.
- Details of discovered vulnerabilities – Describe the vulnerabilities discovered, how they were discovered, and how an adversary can exploit them. Testers need to keep it concise and, if possible, use language that security professionals, developers, and non-technical roles can comprehend.
- Impact on the business – Now that it is evident which vulnerabilities exist, testers must analyse their effect on the business. It is best to use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to rank the severity of the vulnerabilities, and explain which critical systems each vulnerability affects. It is also best to provide a technical walkthrough of the impact if the vulnerability is exploited on the specific organization.
